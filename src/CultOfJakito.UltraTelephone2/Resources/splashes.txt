Ok so i think that ultrakill needs a skbiidi toilet enemy. Why do i think this? well to me ultrakill has secretly been about skibidi toilet this whole time. think about it. if you look back to prelude you can tell that the arenas were perfectly designed for the various skibidi toilets. but thats not all. if you go into the files, you can actually find a skibid i toietl model. but sadly, hakita decided that it would be too scary for the little kids. so he removed it and made it regular toilet. this is why i think that ultrakill NEEDS a skibidi toilet enemy. also, if you could make a camera man mod that would be cool too, but mostly focus on the skibidi toilet if you need to. lastly, i tihnk that having a version of the skibidi toilet be "rizzity toilet" would be really fitting because skibidi toilet got rizz from baby gronks ohio house while fanum taxed kai cenats 10/10 gyatt while gooning to the soyjack peter griffin lego fortnite mode.
